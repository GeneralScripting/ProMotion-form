![form](http://clrsight.co/jh/Screen_Shot_2014-08-29_at_4.03.13_PM.png?+)

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'ProMotion-form'
```

Then:

```sh-session
$ bundle
$ rake pod:install
```

## Usage

Easily create a form screen. Powered by the CocoaPod [FXForms](https://github.com/nicklockwood/FXForms).

*Has all the methods of PM::Screen*

```ruby
class MyFormScreen < PM::FormScreen
  title "My Form"

  def form_data
    [{
      title: "Account Information",
      footer: "Some help text",
      cells: [{
        name: "email",
        title: "ID",
        type: :email,
        value: current_user.email,
      }, {
        name: "password",
        title: "New Password",
        type: :password,
        value: ""
      }]
    }]
  end

end
```

## Styling

#### Method 1: Just slap these onto the cell

```
  "accessoryView"        => CustomAccessory.new,
  "backgroundColor"      => rmq.color.translucent_white,
  "detailTextLabel.font" => rmq.font.label,
}
```

#### Method 2: Put them into a style helper key

```
  style: {
    "accessoryView"        => CustomAccessory.new,
    "backgroundColor"      => rmq.color.translucent_white,
    "detailTextLabel.font" => rmq.font.label,
  },
}
```

#### Method 3: Mix and match

```
  style: {
    "accessoryView"        => CustomAccessory.new,
    "detailTextLabel.font" => rmq.font.label,
  },
  "backgroundColor"      => rmq.color.translucent_white,
}
```

#### Method 4: Use a style

```
def style
  {
    basic: {
      "accessoryView"        => CustomAccessory.new,
      "detailTextLabel.font" => rmq.font.label,
    },
  }
end

...

  style: style(:basic),
}
```

#### Method 5: Combine styles

```
def style
  {
    basic: {
      "accessoryView"        => CustomAccessory.new,
      "detailTextLabel.font" => rmq.font.label,
    },
    alert: {
      "backgroundColor"      => rmq.color.red,
    },
  }
end

...

  style: style(:basic, :alert),
}
```

#### Method 6: Combine styles, with overrides (string keys have higher priority)

```
  style: style(:basic, :alert),
  "backgroundColor" => rmq.color.yellow,
}
```

#### Method 7: Combine styles, with overrides (using '+')

```
  style: style(:basic, :alert) + {
    "backgroundColor" => rmq.color.yellow,
  },
}
```

### What about Formotion?

We have used and like Formotion for some form-heavy apps, but it's a rather bulky gem. ProMotion-form works better with ProMotion and is a lot smaller.

### Methods

#### form_data

Method that is called to build the form.

```ruby
class AccountScreen < PM::FormScreen
  title "Account Info"

  def form_data
    [{
      title: "Account Information",
      footer: "Help text here",
      cells: [{
        name: "email",
        title: "ID",
        type: :email,
        value: current_user.email,
      }, {
        name: "password",
        title: "Password",
        type: :password,
        value: ""
      }, {
        name: :submit,
        title: "Submit",
        type: :button,
        action: "my_action:"
      }]
    }]
  end

  def my_action(cell)
    # cell is the calling cell, in this case the Submit cell
    render_form # use to save the data
  end
end
```

All possible form field properties:

```ruby
{
  label: "Name", # or title:
  name: :name, # defaults to symbol of snake_cased label/title
  type: :string, # :default is default...like a button
  options: [ "Water", "Fire", "Wind" ], # for a subform select (`type` can be anything)
  placeholder: "Your name",
  default: "Jamon", # Coming soon
  value: "Jamon Holmgren",
  action: :"my_action:" # use symbol literal with trailing colon due to Obj-C semantics
}
```

##### Types of fields:

* `:default`
* `:label`
* `:text`
* `:longtext`
* `:url`
* `:email`
* `:phone` - Coming soon
* `:password`
* `:number`
* `:integer`
* `:unsigned` - Coming soon
* `:float`
* `:bitfield`
* `:boolean`
* `:option`
* `:date`
* `:time`
* `:datetime`
* `:image`


#### update_form_data

Forces a reload of the form.

#### render_form

Returns a hash of the fields and values.

```ruby
render_form # => {:email=>"jkdflsljkdsfad", :password=>"asdfadsfadsf", :submit=>""}
```

#### dismiss_keyboard

Dismisses the keyboard. Note that you may need to call this before `render_form` to ensure that you capture the input from the currently focused form element.
